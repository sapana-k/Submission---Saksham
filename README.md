### A Brief of the Prototype:
  Saksham is an app that helps users find whether a particular building has accessibility features for physically challenged people or not, and navigate to them easily using Google Maps API. The app will display information on a building's accessibility provisions on the map, which will be obtained from the building owners who register on the Saksham web portal or even through app.
Users can also provide feedback on a building's accessibility features, which can help other users and the building owners to improve accessibility. Users can find friends and chat with them, thus providing a safe space community.
The app would also provide general information about various government schemes for PWDs and NGO Support

### Tech Stack: 
   Flutter, Firebase, Google Maps API
